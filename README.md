# Fox Trot
* All art and music assets were created by myself using Usenti, Medibang, and Garageband.

## Description
* You move around the map defeating evil spirits in order to recover the shards of your glass bead, which is where all your powers come from. Evil spirits are found in their towers, and you cannot enter the final boss tower until you defeat three spirits.
* You are also able to play minigames around the map by interacting with the colorful raccoons. Winning a minigame will allow you to use a heal during a spirit battle.

### Win Condition
* You must defeat the evil shaman in order to retrieve the last shard of your fox bead. 

### Lose Condition
*  Be defeated in one of the battles.
